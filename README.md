A single-page web app coded for the folks at NOVA Job Center's ProMatch. üíº

An app designed to help people generate PSR (Problem-Solution-Response) stories for job interviews and resume crafting. Create a variety of PSR stories to nip those frustrating interview questions in the bud! üëî

##Inspiration

PSR's provide bite-size stories from a candidate's experience, detailing how they dealt with adversities by:

* Defining the **Problem** they dealt with, ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Outlining the **Solution** they took,
* And talking about the **Response (Results)** that followed. üéâ üíØ üëç

The ideal PSR is supposed to take 90 seconds (verbal), which at 150 words per minute comes out to about 225 words total. ‚è±

This app works to:

* break down the PSR into its respective components,
* keep the word count within the approximate ranges for each section.
* and (in an ideal world) improve the writing. üìà

In the future, I want the app to track the number of words in each section, color-coded for ease of use, and return a value for the number of words (since unlike Twitter, we are aiming for a target word count, not merely "less than 140 characters").

In the future, I want the app to produce an exportable document which people can use to refer back to when preparing for interviews. Most likely this would be a spreadsheet. Since the overall objective of making PSR's is to have a series of them to refer back to when answering questions, the app should be able to accept spreadsheets as well (akin to a "saved game") and allow people to pick up where they left off.

##How to use

1. Type in words to each of the three sections. ‚å®Ô∏è
2. Observe if you're within the correct word range for each section -- You don't want too many or too few words in each. ‚öñÔ∏è
3. (Coming soon) If any of the words, phrases, or sentences are highlighted, correct them -- some sentences wil have to be shortened or split into multiple sentences due to their length, or adverbs might need to be removed, or other similar errors.
