# problem-solution-response
An app coded for the folks at NOVA Job Center's ProMatch. An app designed to help people generate PSR (Problem-Solution-Response) stories.

The ideal PSR is supposed to take 90 seconds (verbal), which at 150 words per minute comes out to about 225 words total. This app works to break down the PSR into its respective components, keep the word count within the approximate ranges for each section, and as a bonus should also help improve the writing.
