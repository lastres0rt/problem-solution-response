# Problem-Solution-Response (PSR)
A single-page web app coded for the folks at NOVA Job Center's ProMatch.

An app designed to help people generate PSR (Problem-Solution-Response) stories for job interviews and resume crafting. Create a variety of PSR stories to nip those frustrating interview questions in the bud!

##Inspiration

PSR's are designed to provide bite-size stories from a candidate's experience, detailing how they dealt with adversities by:

* Defining the **Problem** they dealt with,
* Outlining the **Solution** they took,
* And talking about the **Response (Results)** that followed.

The ideal PSR is supposed to take 90 seconds (verbal), which at 150 words per minute comes out to about 225 words total. 

This app works to:

* break down the PSR into its respective components,
* keep the word count within the approximate ranges for each section.
* and (in an ideal world) improve the writing.

The app tracks the number of words in each section, color-coded for ease of use, and returns a value for the number of words (since unlike Twitter, we are aiming for a target word count, not merely "less than 140 characters").

In the future, the app should produce an exportable document which people can use to refer back to when preparing for interviews. Most likely this would be a spreadsheet. Since the overall objective of making PSR's is to have a series of them to refer back to when answering questions, the app should be able to accept spreadsheets as well (akin to a "saved game") and allow people to pick up where they left off.

##How to use

1. Type in words to each of the three sections:
2. Observe if you're within the correct word range for each section -- You don't want too many or too few words in each.
3. If any of the words, phrases, or sentences are highlighted, correct them -- some sentences wil have to be shortened or split into multiple sentences due to their length, or adverbs might need to be removed, or other similar errors.
