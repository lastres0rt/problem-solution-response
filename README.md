# problem-solution-response
An app coded for the folks at NOVA Job Center's ProMatch. An app designed to help people generate PSR (Problem-Solution-Response) stories.

The ideal PSR is supposed to take 90 seconds (verbal), which at 150 words per minute comes out to about 225 words total. This app works to break down the PSR into its respective components, keep the word count within the approximate ranges for each section, and as a bonus should also help improve the writing.

The app tracks the number of words in each section, color-coded for ease of use, and returns a value for the number of words (since unlike Twitter, we are aiming for a target word count, not merely "less than 140 characters").
